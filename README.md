## ⌘ Quiz from .txt

### This project was created to help myself learn complex English words
### You can create any quiz using this project, by simply creating .txt file with same markdown as shown below
```
file.txt

Question - answer
Question - answer

...and so on
```

### Then, simply replace path in ```main.py``` to your actual .txt file pathname

```
main.py

path = "your_pathname"
```

### ✍️ And now you can run ```main.py``` file and get smooth quiz which will help you learn anything

### And of course, before this don't forget to clone the repo
